## Description

> I want to create an all over board that has a to do list, notes, calender, and more. A place to use dump all of my quick notes throughout the day where I can come back to later and know what they are. I want to be able to see my past onotes through other days that I can go back on and see what I have accomplished and what I still need to get done.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a todo list from scratch but add on more elements to test my abilities a little more with a full-stack application making sure I integrate new applications while maintaing older knowmledge. I want to create a website that is sleek simple and every item has functionality to it. There are asome pieces that I would like to try in order to see how they fuinction together.

## Usage

The use of this application s for users to log into their own personal accounts and have a place to jot down their notes, listen to music and keep track of their daly tasks.
